More women are giving more money to politicians and parties now than they were 20 years ago, 
and Democrats are growing increasingly dependent on their support.
This is an interactive map visualizing the changes in percent of 
Democrat/Republican donations that are made by women, 1992-2012. Darker-colored counties are those where 
contributions to candidates are most polarized, by party. Only counties where women have given at least $25,000 in an election cycle are considered. 

The map was built with D3.js and Javascript.
