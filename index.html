  <h1>The Polarization of Women Donors</h1>
  <p class="date">25 September 2013 </p>
  <p>More women are giving more money to politicians and parties now than they were 20 years ago, 
  <br>and Democrats are growing increasingly dependent on their support. This map shows counties where 
  <br>women have given at least $25,000 in an election cycle. Darker-colored counties are those where 
  <br>contributions to candidates are most polarized, by party.
